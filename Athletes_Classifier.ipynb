    "Professional sporting events have the power to bring friends, families, and co-workers together at home, at bars, and at the venue itself. While most people enjoy the social aspect and the entertainment of the game, few can recognize every single athlete that is on the court, field, or ice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we will be building a model that help solves this problem by classifying NBA players based upon their photo. While this can be extended to a multi-classification problem, this example will focus on a binary classification between two of the top NBA players today - Lebron James and Stephen Curry.\n",
